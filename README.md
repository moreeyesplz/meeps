# MEEPs

This repository is not used to house code, but leverage its issue tracker to track meep requests.

## What is a "meep"

A *meep* is a request for another set of eyes on some code. A meep is created when `[MEEP]` is embedded in the message of a commit pushed to a repository with the [MEEP Scanner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/meep-scanner) action integrated. Once detected, the commit is indexed as an issue [here](https://github.com/moreeyesplz/meeps/issues).

Only meep issues created by `themeepbot` are recognized as meeps from the community.
